event loop phases

timers
pending callbacks
poll
check
close callbacks


timers :- setTimeout and setInterval

pending callbacks:-
execute I/O related callbacks that were deferred (delayed , postponed)

I/O related tasks means:-
tasks that are done by worker pool (heavy tasks done by this)


poll:-

retrieve new I/O events and try to execute there Callbacks , if it is not possible , defer (delay) them 
as a pending callback
or 
execute expired timers if there are any

check:-
execute setImmidiate callbacks

close callbacks:-
execute all close event callbacks

if there are no any event listeners then are open
then
process.exit will be called

--------
fs.writeFile("message.txt" > 1 , dataToWrite > 2 , () => { > 3

})

writing process (data (2) will be written at file at path(1) )will be done by worker pool
and 
callback will be called by event loop
-------
first main thread (worker pool) will execute all the synchronous code and after that it will ,
start executing the aysnchronous code and event loop will execute there respective callbacks
in order of they come in queue

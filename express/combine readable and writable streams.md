# How to Combine Read and Write Streams in Node.js

Combining readable and writable streams in Node.js is commonly done using the `.pipe()` method. This method allows you to take data from a readable stream and send it directly to a writable streamâ€”useful for operations like copying files, compressing, or transforming data.

---

## 1. Basic Example: File Copy

```js
const fs = require('fs');

const readable = fs.createReadStream('input.txt');
const writable = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');

readable.pipe(writable);
```
- This reads from `input.txt` and writes to `output.txt` efficiently using streams.

---

## 2. With Transform Streams (e.g., Compression)

You can also chain streams with transforms, such as gzip compression:

```js
const fs = require('fs');
const zlib = require('zlib');

const readable = fs.createReadStream('input.txt');
const gzip = zlib.createGzip();
const writable = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt.gz');

// Combine: Read -> Gzip -> Write
readable.pipe(gzip).pipe(writable);
```

## 3. File Download Example (HTTP)

You can combine streams to download a file from the internet and save it to disk:

```js
const https = require('https');
const fs = require('fs');

const file = fs.createWriteStream('downloaded-file.jpg');
https.get('https://example.com/image.jpg', (response) => {
  response.pipe(file);
  file.on('finish', () => {
    file.close();
    console.log('Download completed!');
  });
});
```
- Here, `response` is a readable stream for the HTTP response.
- `file` is a writable stream to the local file system.
- The `.pipe()` method streams the downloaded data directly into the file.

---

## 4. Handling Stream Events (Optional)

You can listen to events for error handling or completion:

```js
readable.pipe(writable)
  .on('finish', () => {
    console.log('File has been copied!');
  })
  .on('error', (err) => {
    console.error('Error:', err);
  });
```

---

## 5. Custom Transform Stream Example

You can create your own transform stream to modify data as it passes through:

```js
const { Transform } = require('stream');

const upperCaseTransform = new Transform({
  transform(chunk, encoding, callback) {
    // Convert chunk to upper case
    this.push(chunk.toString().toUpperCase());
    callback();
  }
});

fs.createReadStream('input.txt')
  .pipe(upperCaseTransform)
  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('output-uppercase.txt'));
```

---

## Summary

- Use `.pipe()` to connect readable streams to writable streams.
- You can chain multiple streams (including transform streams).
- This approach is memory-efficient and ideal for large files or real-time data processing.

# Difference between `req.get('host')` and `req.host` in Express.js

In Express.js, both `req.get('host')` and `req.host` are used to obtain host information from the incoming HTTP request, but there are important differences in how they work and what they return.

---

## 1. `req.get('host')`

- **What it does:**  
  Returns the value of the `Host` HTTP header as sent by the client.
- **Usage:**  
  ```js
  const hostHeader = req.get('host');
  ```
- **Details:**  
  - It returns the exact string value from the `Host` header.
  - This may include the hostname *and* the port (e.g., `example.com:3000`).
  - Usually includes hostname and port (e.g., 'localhost:3000')
  - It does not perform any parsing or normalization.
  - Returns exactly what the client sent in the 'Host' header
  - Equivalent to `req.headers['host']`.
  - A method that retrieves the value of the 'Host' HTTP header
  - Part of Express's general header retrieval system (req.get() can retrieve any header)
  - More explicit and predictable across different Express versions

## 2. `req.host`

- **What it does:**  
  Returns the hostname derived from the `Host` HTTP header, with port number stripped.
- **Usage:**  
  ```js
  const host = req.host;
  ```
- **Details:**  
  - Express parses the `Host` header and returns only the hostname, **excluding** the port.
  - A property specifically for host information
  - If the `Host` header is `example.com:3000`, `req.host` will return `example.com`.
  - May apply additional processing or normalization
  - Convenience property provided by Express
  - Can be affected by Express's 'trust proxy' setting
  - If the `X-Forwarded-Host` header is present (and Express is behind a proxy with `trust proxy` enabled), `req.host` may use its value instead.
  - In some Express configurations, might exclude port information (though in your case it includes the port as shown in your output)

## Summary Table

| Expression         | Returns value from         | Includes port? | Example Return Value    |
|--------------------|---------------------------|:--------------:|------------------------|
| `req.get('host')`  | `Host` header             | Yes            | `example.com:3000`     |
| `req.host`         | Parsed from `Host` header | No             | `example.com`          |

## Which should you use?

- Use **`req.get('host')`** if you need to access the full `Host` header (including port).
- Use [req.get('host')]) when you want the raw header value without any processing
- Use **`req.host`** if you only need the hostname without the port.
- Use [req.host]) as a convenience when you specifically need just the host information
- When working behind proxies, be aware that these properties might return different values depending on your Express configuration
- In most standard cases like yours, they'll return the same value

`he`

Contains the URL path relative to the current route
Gets modified as the request moves through middleware and routing
If you have routers mounted at sub-paths, req.url will only contain the portion of the path after the mount point

`req.originalUrl`

Contains the complete original URL as received by the Express application
Remains unchanged throughout the request lifecycle
Preserves the full path regardless of which router or middleware is handling the request
Example
If you have a router mounted at /api and receive a request to /api/users:

```
In the main application: both req.url and req.originalUrl would be /api/users
In the router mounted at /api: req.url would be users while req.originalUrl would still be /api/users
```

This distinction is especially important when working with mounted routers or when middleware manipulates the URL during processing.

# Difference between `req.url` and `req.path` in Express.js

When working with Express.js, both `req.url` and `req.path` are properties of the request object, but they provide different information about the incoming HTTP request:

---

## 1. `req.url`

- **What it does:**  
  Returns the full URL path from the request, including the path and the query string.
- **Example:**  
  For a request to `/users?id=42&name=alex`
  ```js
  req.url // "/users?id=42&name=alex"
  ```
- **Details:**  
  - Contains everything after the domain, starting with `/`.
  - Includes the query string (the part after `?`).

---

## 2. `req.path`

- **What it does:**  
  Returns only the URL path of the request (without the query string).
- **Example:**  
  For a request to `/users?id=42&name=alex`
  ```js
  req.path // "/users"
  ```
- **Details:**  
  - Does **not** include the query string.
  - Only provides the path portion of the URL.

## Summary Table

| Property   | Returns                                     | Includes Query String? | Example Value             |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|:---------------------:|---------------------------|
| `req.url`  | URL path **and** query string from request  | Yes                   | `/users?id=42&name=alex`  |
| `req.path` | Only the URL path                           | No                    | `/users`                  |

## When to Use Each

- Use **`req.url`** if you need the full original URL requested, including any query parameters.
- Use **`req.path`** if you only care about the base route/path, ignoring query parameters.

app.use() vs app.use("/")

identically both are same 
as both will run for all the requests

app.use() will run for every incoming request regardless of url
app.use("/") will run for every incoming request which url starts with "/"
like localhost:3000/

so practically every route start with simple "/"

so it will also execute for every request

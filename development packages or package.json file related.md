for type hinting in vs code:-

https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/node

https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv

if possible

pls mention nodeJS version also in the package.json file
that was used at the time of running the project

use

```
"engines" : {
  "node" : ">=22.16.0",
  "npm" : ">=9.6.7"
}
```

```
~22.16.0 : allows patch updates (22.16.x)
^22.16.0 : allows minor updates (22.x.y)
>=22.16.0 <23.0.0 : specifies a version range
```

mostly use exact version

like
```
{
   "engines" : "22.16.0",
   "npm" : "10.9.2"
}
```

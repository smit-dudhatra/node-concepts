how node js stays performent ?

because of event driven architecture of node js

how request A will be differentiate from request B?

for every incoming request , the request listener will be called each time
hence the data from the request A can't be accessed by request B

single threaded means   
    do one thing at a time
        weather it is time taking or very small process
    single thread == main thread == worker pool

asynchronous means all that tasks that takes time to execute or say they will complete there execution in
some future point of time

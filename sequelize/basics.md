 Sequelize refers to the library itself while sequelize refers to an instance of Sequelize, which represents a `connection to one database`. This is the recommended convention

 models have singular names (such as User) while tables have pluralized names (such as Users), although this is fully configurable.

 all models will be defined on `connection variable` and will return the model class

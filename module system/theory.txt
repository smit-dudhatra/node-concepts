node module system works on the 
import and export functionality

the core module for export is
module
ex:

module.exports

after the sebsequent hierarchy is
 exports.<name>

--------

one file can contains

only one
module.exports because it is default export >> const xyz = require("file path");
>>this is called default export


and may have more than one exports.<name> >> const {abc , def} = require("file path")
>> this is called named export

so the final hierarchy is

module >> exports >> <identifier name>

node has >> export and require
react has >> export and import

------------------

shortcut for named export

module.exports.name = "first name"
module.exports.age = 21

exports.name = "first name";
exports.age = 21

there is no shortcut for default export

only one way for default export

module.exports = "some hard coded value"
